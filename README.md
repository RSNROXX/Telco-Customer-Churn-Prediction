## 📌 Project Overview
Customer Churn (attrition) is a critical metric for subscription-based businesses. This project builds a **Machine Learning pipeline** to predict which customers are at risk of leaving a telecommunications company.

Unlike standard prediction models, this project focuses on **interpretability** and **business value**:
1.  **Recall Optimization:** We prioritize identifying churners (Class 1) to minimize revenue loss.
2.  **"The Why":** We use Logistic Regression Odds Ratios to explain *why* customers leave.
3.  **Efficiency:** We use **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to find the top 10 drivers of churn.

## 🧠 Key Techniques Used
 - Logistic Regression: Selected for its ability to provide probability scores and interpretable coefficients.
 - Class Weight Balancing: Applied class_weight='balanced' to handle the dataset imbalance (Non-Churners > Churners), significantly improving the model's sensitivity.
 - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Automated feature selection to identify the top 10 most impactful features, reducing noise and overfitting.
 - Probability Thresholding: The system outputs exact churn probabilities, allowing for tiered retention strategies.

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Data Generation: Simulating a realistic Telco dataset with missing values and noise.
2. Preprocessing: * Imputing missing TotalCharges.
    - One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables (e.g., Internet Service, Payment Method).
    - Standard Scaling for numerical features.
3. EDA & Baseline: Establishing a performance benchmark.
4. Model Training: Training a Full Logistic Regression model with balanced weights.
5. Feature Selection: Reducing dimensionality using RFE.
6. Evaluation: Analyzing the Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC Curve.
7. Deployment Simulation: A manual interface to input new customer data and get real-time risk predictions.

## 📊 Key Business Insights
Based on the model's Feature Importance (Log-Odds):
 - 🔴 High Risk: Customers with Fiber Optic internet and Electronic Check payments are most likely to churn.
 - 🟢 Retention Drivers: Two-Year Contracts and Tenure (loyalty) significantly reduce the probability of churn.
 - Recommendation: The company should target Fiber Optic users on Month-to-Month contracts with specific long-term offers to improve retention.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RSNROXX/Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction
   ```
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `Telco Customer Churn Prediction.ipynb`

## 📈 Results
| Model | Accuracy | Recall (Churn) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline** | 74% | Low |
| **Full Model (Balanced)** | ~70% | **High** (Prioritized) |
| **RFE Top 10** | ~70% | **High** (Efficient)|

*Note: While balancing classes slightly reduces overall accuracy, it drastically improves our ability to catch churners, which is the primary business objective.*
